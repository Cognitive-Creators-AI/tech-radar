# Aetheron Tech Radar

A living, opinionated map of our engineering stack — inspired by the Thoughtworks Radar, tailored to Aetheron.

## Why this exists
- **Internal**: clear defaults, faster decisions, easier onboarding, a place to propose/track experiments, and shared "when to use X vs Y" guidance.
- **External**: signals we’re modern and intentional, shows quality to candidates/clients, and serves as a strong tech‑marketing asset.

## How it works
Each item is tagged as one of:
- **Primary**: our default choice.
- **Case‑by‑Case**: use when the context merits it.
- **Experiment**: we’re currently trialing this; promising but not default.
- **Avoid**: known tradeoffs or misfit for our goals.

Each entry includes a short rationale and "use when" notes. The radar is collaborative and owned by everyone.

## Contributing
Please scan the radar and open PRs/issues for:
- **Missing tools** you rely on
- **Placement changes** (e.g., should be Primary vs Case‑by‑Case)
- **Clearer “when to use” notes** or better alternatives
- **Experiments** you’re running that could become our go‑to choice

Edit `radar-entries.json` to add/update items and their rings. Open `radar.html` locally to preview.
